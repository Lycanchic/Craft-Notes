Craft Notes is a Digital Brewery Passport.

## User Story

As a craft beer enthusiast the user can search for local breweries where ever the user is located. The user would also be able to save their brewery travels while using the app.
As an user they can have a section for their notes on the brewery.
As the user logs in they will be able to check in to that specific brewery by giving a review on the beer they ordered and the specific brewery the user is at.
A digital stamp appears for that brewery once all guidelines are met by the craft enthusiast.
