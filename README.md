# Craft-Notes

Craft Notes is a Digital Brewery Passport.

## User Story

Craft beer enthusiasts are able to search for local breweries by location. The user will be able to submit feedback via input form, which will be saved as a passport themed profile. Their saved profiles will contain their brewery travels, passport stamps earned, as well as both beer and facility reviews. Which can be accessed at any time by logging into the app.

A digital passport stamp is earned when the user meets the following criteria: checking in to the brewery they are visiting and submitting a review of their beer of choice.

A digital stamp is populated and saved in their passport for that brewery, once all guidelines are met by the craft enthusiast.
